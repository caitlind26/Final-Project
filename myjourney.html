            <p>I started to work out when I realized it was a struggle to hold a milk gallon. I would look up videos on YouTube to find workouts I could do in my room. My 8th grade self wanted to get toned and be able to run for miles without getting tired. However, I lacked the knowledge and proper guidance to reach the goals I wanted to obtain. </p>

            <p>The summer before going into my junior year of high school, I got a gym membership with my brother. He showed me the basics of lifting, but the intimidation I felt in the gym was unmatched. I was surrounded by absolute gym bros and fitness freaks. I felt very out of place and stuck to the women-only fitness room for a while. It took me many weeks before I got over my fear of working out in front of others, especially men and to figure out what I was doing. During this time, I focused heavily on form and tried to not let ego-lifting get the best of me.</p>

        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Now, I can safely say that I know what I am doing in the gym after 4 years of consistent lifting. I no longer feel intimidated when I am the only girl in the gym. If anything, I feel sad that I am the only girl there because I want to see others getting strong. There's a common misconception that lifting as a female makes you bulky, but I hope that after looking through my website, I can inspire young girls and women to ditch the treadmill (only mostly) and pick up the weights! </p>
